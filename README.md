This program allows you to build list based, terminal-ui like workflows for your favorite cli tools.  
It's very much a work in progress and might not work on your machine.  
It also will contain bugs and weird behavior.  

Basic usage:  
1. Create a tuiflow yaml file like in examples/dora-the-explorah.yaml
2. run ./tuiflow <your-file>.yaml
